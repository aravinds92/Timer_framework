Framework for creating multiple timers on linux based systems

Open up the example_timer.c file and create timers using the start_timer function. 
Pass the callback function pointer to start_timer with the timer frequence and mode based on whether the timer is a one shot timer or periodic.

To compile, run make and execute the file obj.
